In personality typology, the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test classifies people according to 16 types. Each type is denoted by 4 letters like "INTJ". 

The letters mean: 

- introversion(I) or extraversion(E) 
- sensing(S) or intuition(N) 
- thinking(T) or feeling(F)
- judging(J) or perceiving(P)
